# Hey You! Shoot Those Balloons!
A game in Unity for mobile

The idea for flingyBall came about from a fairly straightforward question that I had been thinking about for a while. How do we emulate successful mobile games? There must be some common attributes that these things share, that makes them connectable to People.

Well, People are a simple bunch - mired in their complexity. We like to chill. We like to sit around and stare at stuff. Hopefully that stuff is mildly entertaining in some way, but without too much input. A simple feedback loop that allows our brains to get a nice hit, but doesn't cost a large amount of immediate effort. Grooming hair, for instance. Sit, sift, pick, eat, breathe, repeat. Short, simple feedback loops that eventually kinda get somewhere.

Enter the Mobile Phone. Supercharge. Holy shit that's so much feedback my monkey brain just can't deal. Don't we need a break sometimes? Don't we need to relax? Doesn't it seem that more and more people are turning to games to relax? 

Sometimes. I can target that sometimes. That one with the wooly mammoth where you have to spear it was fun. You pull back or something, aim and shoot it or whatever. I lasted at least two days on that one. Might have even paid for it too. Hey fruit ninja went cray. What a simple idea. Swipey swipey.

Swipey swipey.

...

Swipey swipey.

There's gotta be something in that.
